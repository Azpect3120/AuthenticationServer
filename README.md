## Introduction

This project provides a basic template for building a Go authentication server. It includes routes for user login, registration, and profile retrieval, all secured with JWT authentication. You can use this template as a starting point to create your own authentication system for web applications.

## Features

- User authentication using JWT tokens.
- User registration with secure password storage.
- Retrieval of user profiles.
- Basic error handling and logging.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Go (1.16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- Git (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-authentication-server.git
``` 

2. Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure the connection string in the `main.go` file:
```go
  // Replace with your PostgreSQL connection string.
  connectionString := "postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname"
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
  go mod tidy
```

4. Build and run the server:
```bash
  go run cmd/AuthenticationServer/main.go
```
Your authentication server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
